## Comics Calendar

A command line program that works with Nokogiri to fetch release dates for the comics on my savers list. Powered by Ruby, Nokogiri, and RSpec.

### About
I go to the comic shop once a month to pick up my savers list, but the release dates for some comics will change and I got tired of keeping track by checking the website. This way I can input the month, read out the comics that have been released, and even check how much it'll set me back.

The list is currently set to scrape a few Image titles, but can be expanded to work with the entire comic universe.
